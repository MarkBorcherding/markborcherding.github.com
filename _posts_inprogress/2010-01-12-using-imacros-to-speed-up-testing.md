<p>Weve all had a web application that works in such a way that you are required to complete two or three steps in a workflow to get to the specific page youre currently developing. Its a pain to fill out all those required fields, some with complicated regular expression validations (e.g. credit card numbers, e-mail addresses, phone numbers, etc.). It sucks. You have automated acceptance tests, but right now, youre just exploring with some JavaScript or server code. </p>  <p>So what do you do? What is the normal answer to a boring, repetitious problem. Automate it baby! Its not that hard at all.&#160; In acceptance testing Im a big fan of not using the record-and-play type automation. I like seeing the detailed chatter between the browser and the server, but for this throw away situation its perfectly fine.</p>  <p>There are two tools that Ive used to record browser interactions; <a href="http://seleniumhq.org/projects/ide/">Selenium IDE</a> and <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/3863">iMacros</a>. Actually, now that I think about it, there are two more; <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_Center_Test">ACT</a> and <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms364077(VS.80).aspx">VSTS Web Tests</a>. Im going to ignore the last two because I dont find them very friendly and ill suited for what Im doing. </p>  <p>Between the two main options, Selenium IDE and iMacros, I use iMacros only because of its nicer integration with Firefox. I like the docked sidebar window with all the scripts Ive recorded as opposed to Selenium IDEs floating window and needing to load a test suite before being able to run a test. With that said, I do drive all automated acceptance tests with Selenium. The IDE is very useful, the API to interact with the browser has allows all the control I need.&#160; I am very happy with it. </p>  <p>iMacros gives me one button to click to show my scripts.</p>  <p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/image.png"><img style="border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: block; float: none; margin-left: auto; border-top: 0px; margin-right: auto; border-right: 0px" title="image" border="0" alt="image" src="/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/image_thumb.png" width="419" height="220" /></a> </p>  <p></p>  <p>Then a double click takes me where I need to go; simple, fast, efficient. </p>  <p>Recording the scripts are just as easy; click record, use the browser, stop and save.</p>  <p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/image1.png"><img style="border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: block; float: none; margin-left: auto; border-top: 0px; margin-right: auto; border-right: 0px" title="image" border="0" alt="image" src="/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/image_thumb1.png" width="169" height="353" /></a> </p>  <p>iMacro does have the assertions that Selenium IDE has, but in this scenario, I dont care. I dont want to run any assertions, I just want to get where Im going. iMacros has a few other useful scenarios in our organization:</p>  <ul>   <li>Quick smoke test of problem areas </li>    <li>Pre compile pages after deploying website</li> </ul>  <p>These two scenarios are probably better served by Selenium and automated through our build server, but it is really simple to setup a script to do whatever you need it to do. Dont discount its power.</p>
