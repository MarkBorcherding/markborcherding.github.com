Obi-Wan is here. The Force is with him. All right. Well, take care of yourself, Han. I guess that's what you're best at, ain't it? You are a part of the Rebel Alliance and a traitor! Take her away!

##Attack of the Clones
I need your help, Luke. She needs your help. I'm getting too old for this sort of thing. All right. Well, take care of yourself, Han. I guess that's what you're best at, ain't it? Don't act so surprised, Your Highness. You weren't on any mercy mission this time. Several transmissions were beamed to this ship by Rebel spies. I want to know what happened to the plans they sent you.

* What?!
* No! Alderaan is peaceful. We have no weapons. You can't possiblyâ€¦
* Leave that to me. Send a distress signal, and inform the Senate that all on board were killed.
* I call it luck.
* Look, I can take you as far as Anchorhead. You can get a transport there to Mos Eisley or wherever you're going.

##The Rebel Force
Ye-ha! A tremor in the Force. The last time I felt it was in the presence of my old master. You're all clear, kid. Let's blow this thing and go home! Ye-ha!
