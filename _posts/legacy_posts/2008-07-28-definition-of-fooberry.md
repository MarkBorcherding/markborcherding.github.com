This past weekend <a href="http://chasingambulances.blogspot.com/">my girlfriend</a> asked what in the world the name of my blog meant. She said she didn't understand the "Sweetness Without Context" sub title. After thinking about it for a minute I gave her an answer slightly less nerdy than this:

fooberry <span style="color: #ff0000;">/<strong>foo</strong> - ber - ree/</span> <span style="color: #008000;"><em>jargon</em></span>
<ol>
	<li>A <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metasyntactic_variable">metasyntactic <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">variable</span></a> fruit used commonly* in computer science to represent a source of all natural, non-<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_Fructose_Corn_Syrup">high fructose corn syrup</a>, sugary sweetness.</li>
	<li>A derivation of a street near where I live, <em>Hackberry Dr</em>.</li>
	<li>A cool, at least to me, sounding blog name</li>
</ol>
<em>* The term "commonly" is used for small definitions of the word common, meaning less than or equal to only one person.</em>

None of that was much help, except maybe the last one. She still didn't understand what I meant by "foo". I decided to look up the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foo">etymology of "foo"</a>, which was no help and even "foobar" had very little.
<blockquote>In technology, the word was probably originally propagated through system manuals by <a title="Digital Equipment Corporation" href="/wiki/Digital_Equipment_Corporation">Digital Equipment Corporation</a> in 1960s and early 1970s.</blockquote>
Even "FUBAR", to which "foobar" is notsuppose to berelated, provided little certainy; however, one fact did stand out.
<blockquote>FUBAR may have been influenced by the <a title="German language" href="/wiki/German_language">German</a> word <em>furchtbar</em>, meaning terrible. It is pronounced with a soft <em>cht</em>, and probably made the transition during World War II.</blockquote>
Maybe there is some lineage there after all. Knowing what is commonly implemented for "foo", "terrible" is probably a good substitute. I wonder if the "<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hello_world">Hello World</a>" on the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enigma_machine">Enginma </a>was written using <em>furchtbar</em>.

Noneof this has helped me explain "fooberry" to a non-techie. So basically, to me, "fooberry" is a term for something that sweetens whatever it is that you do.

That was actually much easier than explaining my last blog name: <a href="http://wwww.ontologicalreciprocity.com">Ontological Reciprocity</a>. That would take much longer, and I'm not sure I even totally understand it correctly, but it sure sounds cool.
