I cannot get enough of the Olympics.  I watch whatever is on at the moment, and flip between the concurrent events. When I say anything, I mean anything. I've watched <a href="http://www.nbcolympics.com/badminton/index.html">badminton</a>, <a href="http://www.nbcolympics.com/fieldhockey/index.html">field hockey</a>, even <a href="http://www.nbcolympics.com/equestrian/index.html">equestrian</a>. 

When gymnastics came on last night, of course I watched, but I didn't know what I was really watching. I decided it was a lot like NASCAR, which made <a href="http://chasingambulances.blogspot.com/">my girlfriend </a>think I've lost my mind, but it is exactly like NASCAR. <strong>I have no idea what I'm watching, but I know if they crash/fall it's bad, and I really want to see them crash/fall.
</strong> The only differences is I don't watch NASCAR, but if it was an Olympic event I absolutely would!

That probably seems really morbid or horrible. Really though, it all looks the same to me. I get handball. You put the ball in the net more often and you win. I get weightlifting. Lift more weight and you win. I don't get gymnastics and equestrian. Seriously watch an equestrian event. It looks like they are walking around in circles.

Don't get me wrong. I am positive that what each of those athletes do is extremely difficult and I cannot imagine the amount of training, effort and passion it takes to compete at that level. I just can't see what makes someone better than someone else unless they fail miserably.
