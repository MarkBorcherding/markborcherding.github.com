This is going to be short. This week, my company has sent me half way across the country (everything is half way across the country when you are in the mid-west) to SharePoint MOSS Development training in Tampa, Florida. I've been wanting to compile a day-by-day review of the course, in the spirit of <a href="http://ferventcoder.com/archive/2008/11/24/nothin-but-.net-developer-boot-camp---wrap-up.aspx">Ferverent Coder's review of the Nothin' but .Net Developer Boot Camp NBDNDBC</a> (I guess acronyms don't always work). He has a wonderful review of a training seminar I've been wanting to go to for a while now, and his review further solidified my desire to attend. Anyway, I want to do the same thing, but don't have the energy at the end of the day, and my days aren't nearly as long as his.

I did want to pass along some travel tips and tricks I've learned in the past few days that might make your trip more pleasant than mine. 

1. <strong>Fly direct.</strong>  When you have to get from point A to point B, the weather in point C should not be of your concern, unless of course point C is Chicago, Atlanta, Denver, or one of the few other air plane magnets in the country. I didn't have a choice in booking my travel, which could have been booked direct through Southwest, so instead I had a scheduled itinerary of 10 hours, but after delays because of weather half way across the country, it took 15. Google tells me I could have driven the entire length of the journey in 16 hours and Southwest could have brought me there in two. So lesson one, fly direct...or move to a hub city. <em>Programming lesson: Tight coupling is bad.</em>

2. <strong>Bring headphones</strong>. When attending a lecture/lab style training session. It would have been nice to have head phones to drown out the chatter of everyone else or question you don't care to hear answered. <em>Programming lesson: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_Demeter">Law of Demeter</a>.</em> 

Class is starting, so more later.
