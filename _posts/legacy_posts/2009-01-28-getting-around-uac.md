<p>So I never used Vista, except for the 30 minutes between un-boxing my PC and <em>upgrading</em> to Windows XP, until my new position. Its pretty and glossy, but I am starting to understand the UAC headache. So here is one way Im working around the frustration. </p>  <p>Pretend you want to edit a file that needs elevated rights. Usually you wont realize it until youve opened it, attempted to save it, and found it doesnt allow you to so.&#160; Then you open Notepad, browse to the file and then make the change. </p>  <p>I found this helpful article about <a href="http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/windows-vista/customize-the-windows-vista-send-to-menu/">how to customize the Send To menu in Vista</a>. I followed that and added Notepad to that folder twice. One was a regular shortcut, but I renamed the other to Notepad as Administrator. </p>  <p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2009/01/image.png"><img title="image" style="border-right: 0px; border-top: 0px; display: inline; border-left: 0px; border-bottom: 0px" height="185" alt="image" src="/wp-content/uploads/2009/01/image-thumb.png" width="195" border="0" /></a> </p>  <p>Then right click the Notepad as Administrator, click Properties, click Advanced, and then check Run as administrator.</p>  <p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2009/01/image1.png"><img title="image" style="border-right: 0px; border-top: 0px; display: inline; border-left: 0px; border-bottom: 0px" height="298" alt="image" src="/wp-content/uploads/2009/01/image-thumb1.png" width="394" border="0" /></a> </p>  <p>Click OK out of all the dialogs. Now when you right click a file you have a few extra options.</p>  <p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2009/01/image2.png"><img title="image" style="border-right: 0px; border-top: 0px; display: inline; border-left: 0px; border-bottom: 0px" height="504" alt="image" src="/wp-content/uploads/2009/01/image-thumb2.png" width="566" border="0" /></a></p>
