I'm working on layout of new HTML pages and have been adding the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lorem">Lorem Ipsum</a> filler time and time again. At first I just get a browser window with it open, copy and pasted it whenever I needed, but in keeping the desktop clean of clutter, the browser window was often closed, causing me to search for it,  select it, copy, etc. So here's how to save you time:

<ol>
	<li>Create a toolbox tab for common text.</li>
	<li>Select Lorem Ipsum from a file in Visual Studio.</li>
	<li>Drag the text to the toolbar.</li>
	<li>Done.</li>
</ol>

Now when you want to inject the lorem ipsum into the text, just click it on the toolbox item.

Even better, for the ReSharper users, make "lorem" a live template for the entire text. Then you just type "lorem" + tab and you get the entire passage.
