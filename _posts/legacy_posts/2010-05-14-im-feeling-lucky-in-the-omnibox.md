<p>Google gets it right a lot of the time, including bringing back what Im looking for as the first result. I might be one of the few people who actually use the <em>Im Feeling Lucky </em>button on the Google Search page, but I do it in a sneaky way.&#160; I do it from my omnibox in <a href="http://www.google.com/chrome">Google Chrome</a>.</p>  <p>If youre not using the omnibox to search in Chrome, youre not one of the cool kids in my book.&#160; Just type what you want and hit enter to search your default search engine. </p>  <p>What you might not know is you can search other sites as well. Type the domain, press tab and if youve already searched that domain, chances are Chrome will help you out.</p>  <p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/image.png"><img style="border-right-width: 0px; display: inline; border-top-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px" title="image" border="0" alt="image" src="/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/image_thumb.png" width="603" height="193" /></a> </p>  <p>Type your search results and press enter and abracadabra, youre searching Wikipedia. This is very useful as I usually want to search a specific site for my information. </p>  <p>What I also like to do is skip my search results page and follow the Im Feeling Lucky first result. A lot of times Ive already searched for it, or am pretty sure the first hit will get me what I want. To do that setup a new search engine with whatever keyword you want. I picked L, but it could easily be lucky or whatever.</p>  <p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/image1.png"><img style="border-right-width: 0px; display: inline; border-top-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px" title="image" border="0" alt="image" src="/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/image_thumb1.png" width="754" height="660" /></a></p>  <p>Here is the full text of the URL.</p>  <pre>http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=%s&amp;btnI=I%27m+Feeling+Lucky&amp;aq=f&amp;oq=</pre>

<p>&#160;</p>

<p>Now just press L, plus maybe a space, then tab.</p>

<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/image2.png"><img style="border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline; border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px" title="image" border="0" alt="image" src="/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/image_thumb2.png" width="781" height="171" /></a> </p>

<p>True, the page youre going to end up on is the link below , but it takes less time to just type it and press enter than to see if that is what you want, press down and then enter. Also that link isnt always the same location.</p>

<p>Anyway, I hope youre feeling lucky punkAre yafeeling lucky. (you know that was coming)</p>
