I realize I haven't posted a new tip in a while. Maybe the day to daydrudgeryis leaving metemporarilyuninspired. To counteract that, I've dug up an old tip I've sent out a while ago to my coworkers.

If want to find which classes extend your class or implement your interface that currently has focus, press<em> Ctrl + End</em>.

This is really handy to flip between the fakes and real classes during testing. When down in the guts of methods, don't forget that<em> Ctrl + [ </em>will take you back to the enclosing block.

Sorry about the smudgy obfuscation and oversized image. Hopefully we'll have some fresh tips soon.
