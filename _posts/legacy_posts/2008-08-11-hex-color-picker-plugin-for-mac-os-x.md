<p>Today, I was amazed yet again by the flexibility of Mac OS X. I was transitioning the color scheme from my text editor to the syntax highlighter for the blog and needed to convert the RGB values to Hex. The first couple I did manually, but realized there must be a utility out there that would do that for me. I found this nice little <a href="http://wafflesoftware.net/hexpicker/">Hex Color picker</a>.</p><a href="http://wafflesoftware.net/hexpicker/"><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2008/08/hcp1s.png" alt="" title="hcp1s" width="233" height="276" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-210" /></a>
<p>What really amazed me was how easily extensible the Mac system color was. I dropped the plugin file in a folder, restarted my text editor and it was there. No installer. No registry settings. Pretty amazing.
