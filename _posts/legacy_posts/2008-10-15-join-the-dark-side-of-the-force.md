I catch a lot of grief at work, hopefully in jest, about my <em>non-traditional </em>IDE colors. After reading through some links on <a href="http://spietrek.blogspot.com/2008/10/links-1082008.html">A Continuous Learner's Weblog</a> I stumbled upon a link showing people's dark IDE colors, so I thought I would post mine. I've tried a lot of different IDE colors, but still haven't been persuaded away from <a href="/wp-content/uploads/2008/10/fooberrydarkcolors2.vssettings">my color scheme</a>.
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-433" title="12" src="/wp-content/uploads/2008/10/12.png" alt="" width="702" height="603" /></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">I stole the example text from <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/000682.html">CodingHorror</a>. The font is Monaco which comes with Mac OS X, but can also be <a href="http://www.webdevkungfu.com/textmate-envy-aka-monaco-font-for-windows/">found for the PC</a>.</p>
