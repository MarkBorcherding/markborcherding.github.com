I've just impulsively upgraded my Mac Book Pro. When I bought it I opted to fore go the 200GB 7200rpm hard drive upgrade for the satisfaction of walking out of the store with it that very day. I knew any hesitation may result in financially responsible reconsideration. Good thing I didn't! I've been really happy with the MBP, and dream of replacing my commodity desktop with a Mac Pro, but the same financial responsibility buzz kill prevents it.

Anyway, after a brief fight with insomnia last night I decided to upgrade the MBP. I've ordered the following:
<ul>
	<li><a href="http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16822136280">320GB 7200rpm hard disk</a> - $110</li>
	<li><a href="http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16820134605">4GB (2x2GB) DDR2 PC5300 Ram</a> - $75</li>
</ul>
Grand total with free shipping from NewEgg was only $185. Much cheaper than a Mac Pro. The huge hard disk should allow from my XP partition and hopefully an a Ubuntu partition while not feeling cramped in OS X.

My only regret with the MBP is that it doesn't have a nice dock. I suppose a USB port replicator would work well enough, but it seems like such an unsatisfying solution.
