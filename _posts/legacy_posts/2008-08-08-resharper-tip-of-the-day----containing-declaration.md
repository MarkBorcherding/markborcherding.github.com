When you are deep in the bowels of a method body and need to move to the method signature, <code>Ctrl + [</code> will take you to the containing declaring. From there, <code>Ctrl + [</code> will take you to the class definition.

Bonus Non-R# Tip: <code>Ctrl + Minus </code>will move the cursor back to its last position. This is similar to <code>Ctrl + Shift + Bac</code>kspace which will take the cursor back to the last edit location.
