<p>I've been a .Mac subscriber for almost a year now and have found it pretty handy, mostly for iDisk, and the some Mac settings that sync. With the recent introduction of <a href="http://www.apple.com/mobileme/">MobileMe</a>, I'm left a bit perplexed. On launch day I tried to bring up http://mac.com, the old .Mac address and found the maintenance page telling me I needed to hold my horses. That's fine. I fully empathize with deployment pains. So day two rolls around and I finally get to log into .Mac, now Me.com.</p>
<p>This was my nice greeting:</p>

<p>That's od. I'm using FireFox 3.0 on Linux, but it only works with the FireFox on Mac or PC. Hmm... That doesn't make any sense, but OK. Luckily there is a work around. If you install the <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/59?id=59">User Agent Switcher</a> plugin you can fake a browser, or OS version of the browser in this case. IE7 on Vista is a user agent installed by default so I give that a try. It doesn't work, but maybe the plugin doesn't do what it says it does, so I reboot to XP, and try and bring up Mobile Me in Internet Explorer. Now I'm greeted with this:</p>

<p>OK again.You already told me you recommend FF 3.0 or Safari and maybe the plugin actually did work. I'm really not a fan of IE 7, so I'll use FireFox. Great! I can use the web applications, but when I go to setup my Mobile Me Control Panel options, I'm given these choices.</p>

<p>Didn't you just tell me I shouldn't use IE, but you're not going to sync my FireFox bookmarks? That doesn't make any sense Apple!</p>
