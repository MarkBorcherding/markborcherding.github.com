<p>I have to admit, I havent used Visual Studio 2010 much, and only recently have I made an effort to switch to it as my daily editor. One thing Ive noticed is the font rendering in Visual Studio 2010 is a bit bolder than in 2008. </p>  <p>Here we have Visual Studio 2008 on the left and Visual Studio 2010 RC on the right. Both using similar font settings (Monaco 10pt)</p>  <p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/image.png"><img style="border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline; border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px" title="image" border="0" alt="image" src="/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/image_thumb.png" width="702" height="398" /></a> </p>  <p>Its easy to see how the fonts in 2010 (on the right) look bolder and a bit blurry. From what Ive read, WPF has had problem with Clear Type font rendering. This is the first WPF application I use with any appreciation.&#160; </p>  <p>Windows 7 has a tool to help you tune your Clear Type settings. Just type clear type into the start search bar, and you should find the tool. It only takes a few moments, and the outcome was pretty surprising. Ive very happy with the results after the calibration.</p>  <p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/image1.png"><img style="border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline; border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px" title="image" border="0" alt="image" src="/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/image_thumb1.png" width="711" height="413" /></a></p>
