To highlight the usages of a current symbol, you can press <code>Alt + Shift + F11</code>.

Youll see all the usages both in the code view window:
<img src="/wp-content/uploads/2008/07/highlightusage-trans.png" alt="" title="highlightusage-trans" width="488" height="317" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-138" />


and in the right gutter:
<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-132" title="rightgutter" src="/wp-content/uploads/2008/07/rightgutter.png" alt="" width="41" height="140" />

As a bonus tip, you can click on the highlights in the right gutter to go directly to them in the source window.
