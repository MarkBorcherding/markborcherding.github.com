In reference to my previous post about <a href="http://ontologicalreciprocity.com/archive/2008/06/30/unit-tests-everywhere.aspx">collectively running unit tests</a>, I thought I would offer this ReSharper tip.

ReSharpers unit test runner is just plain awesome. Why MSTests dont work like that by default astounds meand is enough reason for me not to use them (although there are several more). One option you have for aggregating which tests you want to run in a single session is to right click on the folder that contains their source, right click and either <em>Run</em> or <em>Debug</em> them.

Im looking for a way to run unit tests in all open documents, but havent found that one yet.
