<p>This weekend I sent a MMS message to a buddy and found a bit of a bug. Hopefully it is an isolated case, but maybe some others are having the same problem. After sending the MMS that contained multiple images, it looked like it sent the same one twice. </p>  <p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/017.png"><img style="border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: block; float: none; margin-left: auto; border-top: 0px; margin-right: auto; border-right: 0px" title="017" border="0" alt="017" src="/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/017_thumb.png" width="320" height="480" /></a> </p>  <p>I didnt send my buddy two pictures of the same bottle of tequila, nor did I send him three message. When I touch the suspect image, I see it is actually the correct one. </p>  <p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/018.png"><img style="border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: block; float: none; margin-left: auto; border-top: 0px; margin-right: auto; border-right: 0px" title="018" border="0" alt="018" src="/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/018_thumb.png" width="320" height="480" /></a> </p>  <p>Hmm..Odd. It would be nice if they appeared in order toosince it apparently knows what I was trying to do, it broke up the message correctly, but just didnt place them in the correct order. It would be better if they appeared like this.</p>  <p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/017b.png"><img style="border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: block; float: none; margin-left: auto; border-top: 0px; margin-right: auto; border-right: 0px" title="017b" border="0" alt="017b" src="/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/017b_thumb.png" width="320" height="480" /></a> </p>  <p>That looks like what I sent.</p>  <p>Is anyone else having the same MMS problem I am seeing?</p>
