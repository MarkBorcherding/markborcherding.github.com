Very painful at times. Throwing away our Team City builds because TFS 2010 didnt support it really hurt. It was a big woops that I regret. </p>  <p>Moving to Visual Studio 2010 Beta was painful too. Visual Studio worked fine, but no ReSharper made it painful. Even in the early days, ReSharper was not stable in 2010, but after a few months, things look good now. ReSharper and VS 2010 are playing nice together. </p>  <p>There is one last pain point. No Xunit.net test runner. Xunitcontrib provides a ReSharper 5.0 build, but I was never able to get it to workuntil now. Previously I was getting <a href="http://xunitcontrib.codeplex.com/Thread/View.aspx?ThreadId=79225">the same problem seen by others</a>.</p>  <blockquote>   <p>The plugin xunit could not be loaded from &quot;C:\program files(x86)\jetBrains\resharper\v5.0\bin\plugins\xunit.dll&quot; or one of its dependencies.&#160; Operation is not supported.&#160; (Exception from HRRESULT: 0x801311515)</p> </blockquote>  <p>I tried the best I could to <em>right-click | Properties | Unblock</em> all the files in the plug-in, but the Unblock never worked. I would get the same error. Going back into the properties dialog, the unblock would appear again. It looked like the unblock wasnt sticking. </p>  <p>After a quick Google search, I found an <a href="http://forum.soft32.com/windows/unblock-files-command-line-ftopict307142.html">alternative way to unblock files</a>. <strong>Copy the files to a FAT 32 and back. </strong>The block is stripped. Sweet! My USB key is FAT 32, and after a quick copy and back. No more errors! ReSharper sees and runs my Xunit.net tests. </p>  <p>Just a quick overview of how I installed the plug-in:</p>  <ol>   <li>Close Visual Studio.</li>    <li>Copy the contents of the ExternalAnnotations to:     <br />C:\Program Files (x86)\JetBrains\ReSharper\v5.0\Bin\ExternalAnnotations</li>    <li>Create a folder:     <br />C:\Program Files (x86)\JetBrains\ReSharper\v5.0\Bin\plugins\xunitcontrib.runner.resharper.5.0</li>    <li>Copy everything else to the USB key.</li>    <li>Copy it to the folder I just created in step #3.</li>    <li>Open Visual Studio and run all my tests. </li> </ol>
