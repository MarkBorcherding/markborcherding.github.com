I almost jumped the gun and sent out two tips of the day because this one was so cool. When you are browsing the source of some other class and want to go back to the source you were changing, press <em>CTRL + Shift + Backspace</em> and it will take you back to the place in the code where last change you made.
Thats not cool enough for you? Press it again itll go to your change before that. Press it again and you get the idea.
