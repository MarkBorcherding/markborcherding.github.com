I've been using this tip a lot today, so I thought I would post an internal tip passed along by Josh Buedel, a super sharp coworker of mine. 

<blockquote>Some folks are real anal about how their class members are organized within a class.  Often I find myself working on two members within a single class and I want them juxtaposed just for that editing session.  Eventually I want to put them back.  Whatever the reason, reorganizing members via cut and paste can turn into a mistake prone mess, especially when method bodies are long.  

R# to the rescue with the Move Member Up/Down feature.  Place your cursor anywhere on a members signature area, <em>then Ctrl+Alt+Shift+(Up|Down) </em>to move the entire member either up or down, shifting other code around it as you go.  This works on methods, properties, even nested classes.  And it pulls your 3 bar /// code comments along with it.  Check out this sweet vid.

<em>Bonus!</em>:  Issuing that four fingered hot key combo feels like youre giving your IDE a so-whos-the-boss-now-huh b!tch slap.</blockquote>
