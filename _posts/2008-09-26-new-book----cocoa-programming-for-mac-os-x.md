<p style="text-align: justify;">I know I shouldn't be picking up <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Cocoa-Programming-Mac-OS-3rd/dp/0321503619/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1222404711&amp;sr=8-1">another book</a> while there are still several on my reading list, one I'm still half way through, and branching into a completely <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Presentation_Foundation">new arena</a> at work. The upgrades to the MBP made me consider why I do all my development through the virtual machine and don't do anything natively. This doesn't count the time I've spent<a href="http://www.amazon.com/RailsSpace-Building-Networking-Addison-Wesley-Professional/dp/0321480791/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1222405055&amp;sr=8-1"> tooling around with another language</a>. Yet another book started, but never finished.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I have no ambitions on reading this right away, but hope to get to it soon, if only in a diminished capacity. There is still the matter of finishing the <a href="/2008/08/21/review-pragmatic-programmer-part-1/">last book I started</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">While at the bookstore looking for something that might help with the new arena, I noticed <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Sams-Teach-Yourself-COBOL-Hours/dp/0672314533/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1222405542&amp;sr=8-2">a book</a> that I couldn't help but picking up and laugh. Behind it was this book, the only OS X programming book in the whole store. It must have been placed there as joke.</p>
