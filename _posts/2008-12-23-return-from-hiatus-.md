There has been a lot going on lately that prevented me from posting as often as I should. The good news is I've taken a new job which is sure to provide many exciting new challenges to share. The bad news is the new organization isn't currently using ReSharper. This is something that I hope to remedy, but the ReSharper tips of the day might not return.
