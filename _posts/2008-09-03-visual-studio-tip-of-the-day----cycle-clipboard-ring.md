In conversation Sean pointed out that Emacs has a clipboard ring that will allow you to cycle through the most recent copied/cut items and the Visual Studio had similar functionality. I immediately went to find it and was shocked to see it right therein the Edit menu.

Pretty simple. <em>Ctrl+Shift+V</em> will paste and then select the previous item in the clipboard ring. To repeatedly paste the item once you found it you can switch to <em>Ctrl+V</em>.

Tomorrow's tip: The Del key will delete the selected text. See the same screenshot.
