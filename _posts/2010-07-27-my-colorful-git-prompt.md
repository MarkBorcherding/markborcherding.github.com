We all like color dont we? We also love the command line right? Well, if you dont, you should love it. There is nothing I hate more than seeing a screen full of gray text. You can provide a lot of context via color, especially in your prompt.

Take my git prompt for example.&#160; I easily know if I have any changes in the branch, if Im staging changes and an overview of the changes.

This is done in PowerShell. If youre still using cmd as your shell, you should stop immediately. Especially if you use git. I highly recommend checking out <a href="http://github.com/dahlbyk/posh-git">posh-git</a>. Auto-complete on git commands and branch names is awesome.

lso, you can checkout the <a href="http://github.com/MarkBorcherding/roaming-profile/tree/master/powershell/">source for this prompt</a>. Figuring out all the changes takes some time on a large codebase, but for me its worth it.
