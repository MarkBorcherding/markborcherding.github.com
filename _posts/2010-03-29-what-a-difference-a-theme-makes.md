<p>Some of you non-RSS readers might have noticed about a month ago I changed the theme of my blog. Ive received several complaints about the background and dont really feel like messing with the getting a new one right, so lets just change the whole theme. </p>  <p>I was quite partial of the background as it was an abstract shot I took of a local landmark, but I had to yield to the massesthats a bit of an overstatement I guess; however, I cant argue with the success. </p>  <p>Just take a look at the bounce rate of the blog over the past month. I will give you one guess when I changed the theme. </p>  <p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/SS2010.03.2910.51.37.png"><img style="border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline; border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px" title="SS-2010.03.29-10.51.37" border="0" alt="SS-2010.03.29-10.51.37" src="/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/SS2010.03.2910.51.37_thumb.png" width="616" height="131" /></a> </p>  <p>Pretty shocking huh? As a friend pointed out, the lower bounce rate could be because the visitors are lost or dont know where to find what they are looking for, but as as 80% is coming in off keyword traffic and 19% are coming from my linked articles on StackOverflow, I dont think thats a problem. </p>
