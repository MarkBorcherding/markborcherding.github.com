After a day or two hiatus, we're hopefully back to blogging. Fooberry has a new
look and hopefully loads of new content just waiting to pour out to the
interwebs.

Since I've stopped blogging there has been a lot of changes. I've left my
traditional .Net job and have taken a Ruby developer position at [Natron
Baxter](http://natronbaxter.com) building games that better the world and its
people. A bold claim, but we're trying to make it true. I regret not blogging
along my journey, but there's not better time to correct that mistake than the
present, but you don't care about this babble anyway. So I'm off.
