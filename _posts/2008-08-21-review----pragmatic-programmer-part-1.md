After a few days vacation, I didn't end up finishing the Pragmatic Programmer, but I made a significant dent in it. I read the first half on the way out, but spent the rest of the time relaxing by the lake or napping in the hammock. I'm glad I didn't finish the rest of it because it was nice not doing anything.

I've found the book a surprisingly easy read so far. Most technical computer books I've read take some serious brain power to chew through; however, this one provided plenty of analogies such as <em>Stone Soup, Helicopter Controls, </em>and <em>Broken Windows</em>that even a non-technical person can grasp what he is saying at first glance.

One part of the book highlighted a talent of programmers I've admired. In chapter 4, if I recall, it mentions how the shell isextremelypowerful and worth the investment to learn. I whole heartedly agree. In addition, it recommend to know and use a single editor.

I look forward to the rest of the book. Hopefully it doesn't start collecting dust.
