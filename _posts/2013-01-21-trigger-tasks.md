I've recently started working on a Trigger.io port of our native iOS app. Some of the workflow is
a bit repetitive. To ease this I've started a new set of [Rake](http://rake.rubyforge.org/) tasks
to make life a bit less painful. Introducing [trigger-tasks](https://github.com/MarkBorcherding/trigger-tasks).

Right now it is very much in flux. It is a dump of what my project's `Rakefile` looked like. Over time
it will become more organized and useful.
