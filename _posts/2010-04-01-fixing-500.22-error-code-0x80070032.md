An ASP.NET setting has been detected that does not apply in Integrated managed pipeline mode.</pre>

<p>&#160;</p>

<p>Well the Visual Studio engineers deserve a hand for helping me get this going.&#160; After spending a minute looking into the web.config to find out what was wrong, I ran into this little bit of commented out configuration.</p>

<pre class="xml" name="code">&lt;!--
        The system.webServer section is required for running ASP.NET AJAX under Internet
        Information Services 7.0.  It is not necessary for previous version of IIS.

	&lt;system.webServer&gt;

        ...then some more config</pre>

<p>&#160;</p>

<p>That is exactly what was needed to take us into integrated mode in IIS, which is needed for MVC. </p>
