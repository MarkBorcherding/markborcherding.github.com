<p>There are some <a href="http://www.apple.com/safari/whats-new.html#developer">developer features</a> hidden in the new beta of Safari. They are a bit hidden, which is fine since most people browsing the web dont care to inspect the elements of the page theyre browsing, but as a developer, this is a must. </p>  <p>Turn on the develop menu item in the advanced settings.</p>  <p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2009/02/image3.png"><img title="image" style="border-right: 0px; border-top: 0px; display: inline; border-left: 0px; border-bottom: 0px" height="301" alt="image" src="/wp-content/uploads/2009/02/image-thumb4.png" width="466" border="0" /></a> </p>  <p>Show the menu bar. I havent found a way to get to it without the menu, but I havent really looked into it yet.</p>  <p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2009/02/image4.png"><img title="image" style="border-right: 0px; border-top: 0px; display: inline; border-left: 0px; border-bottom: 0px" height="387" alt="image" src="/wp-content/uploads/2009/02/image-thumb5.png" width="340" border="0" /></a> </p>  <p>And now you have all the tools you would expect to see and then some!</p>  <p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2009/02/image5.png"><img title="image" style="border-right: 0px; border-top: 0px; display: inline; border-left: 0px; border-bottom: 0px" height="375" alt="image" src="/wp-content/uploads/2009/02/image-thumb6.png" width="438" border="0" /></a></p>

They look <a href="http://www.google.com/chrome/">eerily familiar</a> don't they?

<strong>Update:</strong> The presence of the Develop menu is not new with Safari 4, but there are several updated and additional features in the beta.
