<p> Its probably hard to find a programmer whom hasnt asked, answered or read a question on Stack Overflow these days. Its becoming, if not already, the wealthiest pool of talented developers and all those brains are just seething for a challenge. Your problem is another mans puzzler. </p>  <p>So youve asked your question, and now spend every other minute returning to the website to see if anyone has saved your day, or ridiculed your ignorance. Well, theres an easier way may friends. Even easier than e-mail notifications. </p>  <p><strong>RSS feeds.<img style="border-right-width: 0px; margin: 0px auto; display: block; float: none; border-top-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px" border="0" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2378/2308324544_0ba0bbe15c_o.jpg" width="421" height="316" /></strong></p>  <p>it might be easily over looked, but in the bottom of every question there is an RSS feed for that individual question. </p>  <p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/image.png"><img style="border-right-width: 0px; display: block; float: none; border-top-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; margin-left: auto; border-left-width: 0px; margin-right: auto" title="image" border="0" alt="image" src="/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/image_thumb.png" width="522" height="284" /></a> </p>  <p>In fact, there are a couple feeds provided by SO, but for me, today, this one is Queen Bee. Well, this feed and the new Google Reader extension to Google Chrome. Once I get this feed into my Google Reader, all I need to do is wait</p>  <p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/image1.png"><img style="border-right-width: 0px; display: block; float: none; border-top-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; margin-left: auto; border-left-width: 0px; margin-right: auto" title="image" border="0" alt="image" src="/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/image_thumb1.png" width="216" height="91" /></a> </p>  <p>and wait.and stareand wait.and stareand wait for the feed icon to update.</p>  <p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/image2.png"><img style="border-right-width: 0px; display: block; float: none; border-top-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; margin-left: auto; border-left-width: 0px; margin-right: auto" title="image" border="0" alt="image" src="/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/image_thumb2.png" width="210" height="90" /></a> </p>  <p>Sweet. Someone solved my problem. Nope, just a comment telling me Im an idiot, but hopefully my rephrased question makes enough sense to get a valid answer. </p>  <p>Feeds make it easy to subscribe to specific information you wish to monitor and lets you do so in a central, e-mail free way. So subscribe until your hearts content, but dont forget to drop the old questions you no longer care about. </p>
