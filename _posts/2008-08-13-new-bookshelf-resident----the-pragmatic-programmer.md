I should come up with a new title for this category. Hopefully it is not a bookshelf resident, but gets read, passed around, written in, referenced, anything but sitting around gathering dust.

After a recommendation from a friend, and anticipating an upcoming vacation, I decided to use a Barnes and Nobel gift card to add <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Pragmatic-Programmer-Journeyman-Master/dp/020161622X/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1218587060&amp;sr=8-1">The Pragmatic Programmer</a> to my bookshelf.
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Pragmatic-Programmer-Journeyman-Master/dp/020161622X/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1218587060&amp;sr=8-1"><img class="size-medium wp-image-233 alignright" title="The Pragmatic Programmer" src="/wp-content/uploads/2008/08/280-238x300.jpg" alt="" width="167" height="210" /></a>
It has come highly recommended and I look forward to getting into later this week. I was pretty sure <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dave_Thomas_(programmer)">David Thomas</a> was the origin of the <a href="http://rtpscrolls.blogspot.com/2006/11/angry-monkeys-and-cargo-cults.html">Angry Monkeys</a>. In addition, he has several other books from his <a href="http://www.pragprog.com/">pragmatic bookshelf</a> which are all highly rated.

I'll be sure to post more as I make my way through it.

I passed on several other books. I was also considering, in several combinations:
<ul>
	<li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Beautiful-Code-Leading-Programmers-Practice/dp/0596510047/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1218590669&amp;sr=1-1">Beautiful Code</a></li>
	<li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Xcode-3-Unleashed-Fritz-Anderson/dp/0321552636/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1218590710&amp;sr=1-1">XCode 3 Unleashed</a></li>
	<li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Beautiful-Evidence-Edward-R-Tufte/dp/0961392177/ref=pd_bbs_sr_3?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1218590789&amp;sr=1-3">Beautiful Evidence</a> by Edward Tufte</li>
	<li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Here-Comes-Everybody-Organizing-Organizations/dp/1594201536/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1218590915&amp;sr=1-1">Here Comes Everybody</a>by Clay Shirky</li>
	<li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Myths-Innovation-Scott-Berkun/dp/0596521847/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1218590989&amp;sr=1-1">The Myths of Innovation</a></li>
</ul>
After seeing the alternate cover for Here Comes Everybody, I remember where I first heard about it. Jeff Atwood wrote a <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/001122.html">post about him</a> recently. Maybe that book bumps up a few notches on my reading list now.
