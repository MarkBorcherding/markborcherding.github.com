Seeing the referring URLs to fooberry.com has introduced me to some new sources of information. Even though there arent that many referring URLs, yet, they have some really great stuff. 

The one that has the most diverse information in a single post is <a href="http://spietrek.blogspot.com/">A Continuous Learners Weblog</a>. Its really great that he records the links hes found useful over the past week or so. Its something that I wish I had perseverance to do.

Anyway, to the tip of the day <a href="http://spietrek.blogspot.com/2008/08/links-862008.html">He linked to my tip of the day</a>, which led me to <a href="http://codeclimber.net.nz/archive/2008/08/06/how-to-disable-resharper-for-a-file-ctrl-8.aspx">this tip</a>. 

<blockquote>How to disable ReSharper for a file: [CTRL + 8]</blockquote>
