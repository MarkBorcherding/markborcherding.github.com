Checking the event viewer I found the following errors.</p>  <blockquote>   <p>The worker process failed to initialize correctly and therefore could not be started.&#160; The data is the error.</p> </blockquote>  <p>Followed by</p>  <blockquote>   <p>The worker process failed to pre-load .Net Runtime version v4.0.20506.</p> </blockquote>  <p>The Google was no help. It returned a handful of result that werent all that helpful, but one post was interesting. Someone had a similar problem with the&#160; 2.0 runtime when upgrading to the beta and found there were tiny bits of the other runtime sticking around. </p>  <p>I had .Net 4.0 Beta 1 installed before, so I did some digging and found I had the Beta framework:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>C:\Windows\Microsoft.NET\Framework\v4.0.21006      <br />C:\Windows\Microsoft.NET\Framework64\v4.0.21006</p> </blockquote>  <p>I also had folders from the Beta 1</p>  <blockquote>   <p>C:\Windows\Microsoft.NET\Framework\v4.0.20506      <br />C:\Windows\Microsoft.NET\Framework64\v4.0.20506</p> </blockquote>  <p>I deleted those folders, restarted the .Net 4.0 app pools and and hard restart just to be safe. Everything worked. Two hours on a Friday wasted, but we weekend free of worry. </p>
