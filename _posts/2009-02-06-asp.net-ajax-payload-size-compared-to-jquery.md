<p>Let me start off by saying this isnt scientific, or possibly even accurate, but was pretty shocking at first glance. I wanted to take a look at what the true size of our pages were, so I brought up Chromes nice resource inspector and refreshed and average page from our intranet application. It was a bit shocking at first.</p>  <p><img title="image" style="border-right: 0px; border-top: 0px; display: block; float: none; margin-left: auto; border-left: 0px; margin-right: auto; border-bottom: 0px" height="87" alt="image" src="/wp-content/uploads/2009/02/image-thumb.png" width="547" border="0" /></p>  <p> All that orange is javascript! Now, I know the browser is probably caching that, when it goes through IIS  Cassini wont cache it, butit still seems like a pretty big chunk, but its probably all the jQuery and jQuery plugins were using right?</p>  <p></p>  <p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2009/02/image.png"><img title="image" style="border-right: 0px; border-top: 0px; display: inline; border-left: 0px; border-bottom: 0px" height="51" alt="image" src="/wp-content/uploads/2009/02/image-thumb1.png" width="468" border="0" /></a> </p>  <p>Without the rest of the files, its hard to put that into perspective, but trust me ,that is pretty small. What about the plugins?</p>  <p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2009/02/image1.png"><img title="image" style="border-right: 0px; border-top: 0px; display: inline; border-left: 0px; border-bottom: 0px" height="308" alt="image" src="/wp-content/uploads/2009/02/image-thumb2.png" width="591" border="0" /></a> </p>  <p></p>  <p>Those are pretty small too. All that javascript has to be somewhere right? What about ASP.Net Ajax?</p>  <p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2009/02/image2.png"><img title="image" style="border-right: 0px; border-top: 0px; display: inline; border-left: 0px; border-bottom: 0px" height="308" alt="image" src="/wp-content/uploads/2009/02/image-thumb3.png" width="640" border="0" /></a> </p>  <p>I had to scale the image so it would fit, but there is a lot there. You may have noticed that we are using the min version of the jQuery file. Is the ASP.Net Ajax minified?</p>  <p><strong>NOPE!</strong></p>  <p>I havent really looked to see if it is possible to shrink that JS somehow, well see about doing that soon.</p>
